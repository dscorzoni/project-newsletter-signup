## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I learned a lot in this exercise as I still don't have that much practices with Javascript, so it was super nice to learn how to work with form validation. Also, another interesting learning was toggling classes for the different objects in the page to define when to display the form and when to display the success message.
